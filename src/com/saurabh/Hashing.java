 * hashCode() method is used to get hasCode of an object.Hash code method of object class returns
 * the memory reference of the object in the integer form. Defination of the hashcode is public native hashCode()
 * In hashMap , hasCode is used to calculate the bucket size and therefore calculate the index.
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *  We can override hashCode() and implement our own hashCode method and also we can override the equals
 *  method of the object to implement our own equals mehod. In HashMap equals method is used to check 
 *  the key are same or not. if it is same then it return true otherwise it returns false.
